The Pica AI SDK is a TypeScript library for integrating Pica with [Vercel's AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai).

For detailed instructions and examples, view the [documentation](https://docs.picaos.com/sdk/vercel-ai).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @picahq/ai
```

## Setup

1. Create a new [Pica account](https://app.picaos.com)
2. Create a Connection via the [Pica Dashboard](https://app.picaos.com/connections)
3. Create a [Pica API key](https://app.picaos.com/settings/api-keys)
4. Set the API key as an environment variable: `PICA_SECRET_KEY=<your-api-key>`

## Configuration

The Pica SDK can be configured with the following options:

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| serverUrl | String | No | https://api.picaos.com | URL for self-hosted Pica server |
| connectors | String[] | No | - | List of connector keys to filter by. Pass `["*"]` to initialize all available connectors, or specific connector keys to filter. If empty, no connections will be initialized |
| identity | String | No | None | Filter connections by specific identifier |
| identityType | `"user"` \| `"team"` \| `"organization"` \| `"project"` | No | None | Filter connections by identity type |
| authkit | Boolean | No | false | If true, the SDK will use Authkit to connect to prompt the user to connect to a platform that they do not currently have access to |
| knowledgeAgent | Boolean | No | false | If true, the SDK will never execute actions, but will use Pica's knowledge to generate code. If true, use pica.intelligenceTool instead of pica.oneTool |
| knowledgeAgentConfig | Object | No | `{ includeEnvironmentVariables: true }` | Configuration for the Knowledge Agent. If `includeEnvironmentVariables` is true, the SDK will return a reminder to include environment variables in the output |

## Usage

The Pica AI SDK is designed to work seamlessly with [Vercel AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai). Here's an example implementation with Next.js:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { convertToCoreMessages, streamText } from "ai";
import { Pica } from "@picahq/ai";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  const pica = new Pica(process.env.PICA_SECRET_KEY!, {
    connectors: ["*"],
  });

  const systemPrompt = await pica.generateSystemPrompt();

  const stream = streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4.1"),
    system: systemPrompt,
    tools: { ...pica.oneTool },
    messages: convertToCoreMessages(messages),
    maxSteps: 10,
  });

  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```
